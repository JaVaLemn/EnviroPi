# Hello!

Hello, I'm JaVaLemn, a regular middle-school coder from the United States :D I love to use all sorts of code languages, like HTML and Python! Currently I'm working on an environmental code with my friends using a Raspberry Pi and some sensors. It's really cool! You can take a look at the notebook titled "Enviro Masters Code". 

If you want to use my code, want to add some things, or see a typo/bug, please let me know! :)

Special thanks to Dr. Thomas Proffen and Amelie Nagle for being awesome ðŸ¦„
